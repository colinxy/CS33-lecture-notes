 - cache


*** Cache Concepts

 - hit
 - miss

*** Cache Perfoemance Metrics

*** Cache Friendly Code

*** Memory Mountain

 - read throughput
   - number of bytes read from memory per second
 - memory mountain
   - measured read throughput as a function of spatial and
     temporal locality
   - compact way to characterize memory system performance
     - Temporal locality refers to the reuse of specific data,
       and/or resources, within a relatively small time duration.
     - Spatial locality refers to the use of data elements within
       relatively close storage locations
     - stride
     - size
