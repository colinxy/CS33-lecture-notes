 - 8-bit floating point representation
   - the sign bit is in the most significant bit
   - the next four bits are the exponent, with a bias of 7
   - the last 3 bits are the frac

** Distribution of Values

 - 6-bits IEEE-like format
   - e = 3 exponent bits
   - f = 2 fraction bits
   - bias is 2^{3-1} - 1 = 3
   - ditribution gets denser toward 0

** Special Properties of the IEEE Encoding

 - floating point 0 is the same as integer 0
   - all bits 0

 - can almost use unsigned integer comparison
   - must first compare sign bits
   - must consider -0 = 0
   - =NaN= (s) problematic
     - will be greater than any other values
     - what should comparison yield
   - otherwise OK
     - denormalized vs normalized
     - normalized vs infinity

** Floating Point Operation

 - basic idea
   - first compute exact result
   - make it fit into desired precision
     - possibily overflow if exponent too large
     - possibily round to fit into fraction part of float

*** Round to Even

**** Rounding Modes

| mode               | =1.40= | =1.60= | =1.50= | =2.50= | =-1.50= |
|--------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+---------|
| towards 0          | =1=    | =1=    | =1=    | =2=    | =-1=    |
| round down -\infty | =1=    | =1=    | =1=    | =2=    | =-2=    |
| round up +\infty   | =2=    | =2=    | =2=    | =3=    | =-1=    |
| nearest even       | =1=    | =2=    | =2=    | =2=    | =-2=    |

 - round-to-even: default rounding mode
   - hard to get any other kind wothout dropping into assembly
   - all other are statistically biased
     - sum of set of positive numbers will consistently
       be over or under estimated

 - applying to other decimal places / bit positions
   - when exactly halfway between 2 possible values
     - *round so that least significant digit is even*

**** rounding binary numbers

 - binary fractional numbers
   - "even" when least significant bit is 0
   - "half" way when bits to right of rounding position = 100..._{2}

#+CAPTION: round to nearest 1/4 (2 bits right of binary point)
| value | binary    | rounded | action | bounded |
|-------+-----------+---------+--------+---------|
| 3/32  | =0.00011= | =0.00=  | down   | 0       |
| 3/16  | =0.00110= | =0.01=  | up     | 1/4     |
| 7/8   | =0.11100= | =1.00=  | up     | 1       |
| 5/8   | =0.10100= | =0.10=  | down   | 1/2     |


*** Floating Point Multiplication

 - \( (-1)^{s1} M 2^{E1} \times (-1)^{s2} M 2^{E2} \)
 - exact result (-1)^{s} M 2^{E}
   - sign =s=: =s1 ^ s2=
   - significand =M=: =M1 * M2=
   - exponent =E=: =E1 + E2=
 - fixing
   - if =M= >= 2, shift =M= right, increment =E=
   - if =E= out of range, overflow
   - round =M= to fit =frac= precision
 - implementation
   - biggest chore is multiplying significand


*** Floating Point Addition

 - \( (-1)^{s1} M 2^{E1} + (-1)^{s2} M 2^{E2} \)
 - exact result: (-1)^{s} M 2^{2}
   - sign =s=, significand =M=:
     - result of signed align & add
   - exponent =E=: =E1=
 - fixing
   - if M >= 2, shift =M= right, increment =E=
   - if M < 1, shift =M= left =k= positions, decrement =E= by =k=
   - overflow if =E= out of range
   - round =M= to fit =frac= range

*** Floating Point in C

 - C guarantees two levels
   - =float= single precision
   - =double= double precision
 - conversion/casting
   - casting between int, float, and double changes bit representation
   - =double/float= ==> =int=
     - truncates fractional part
     - like rounding towards 0
     - not defined when out of range or NaN: generally sets to =TMIN=
   - =int= ==> =double=
     - exact conversion, as long as =int= has <= 53 word size
   - =int= ==> =float=
     - will round according to rounding mode

**** Floating Point Puzzle

#+BEGIN_SRC C

  int x;
  float f;
  double d;

#+END_SRC

| condition | expression       | result | explanation                                                  |
|-----------+------------------+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
| =f=       | =-(-f)=          | true   |                                                              |
| =d < 0.0= | =(d * 2 < 0.0)=  | true   |                                                              |
| =d > f=   | =-f < -d=        | true   |                                                              |
|           | ~d*d >= 0.0~     | true   |                                                              |
|           | ~(d+f) - d == f~ | false  | add a large number d to a small number f, precision overflow |


** Summary

 - IEEE Floating Point has clear mathematical properties
 - represents numbers of form \( M \times 2^{E} \)
 - can reason about operations independent of implementation
   - as if computed with perfect precision then rounded
 - not the same as real arithmetic


* Optimization

** Optimizing Compilers

 - provide efficient mapping of program to machine
   - register allocation
   - code selection and ordering (scheduling)
   - dead code elimination
   - eliminating minor inefficiencies

 - don't improve asymptotic efficiency
   - up to programmers to select best overall algorithms
   - big-O savings are (often) more important than constant factors

 - have difficulty overcoming "optimization blockers"
   - potiential memory aliasing
   - potiential procedure side-effect


** Generally Useful Optimizations

optimizations that you or the compiler should do regardless of processor/compiler

*** Example of Memory Aliasing

#+BEGIN_SRC C

  void sum_row2(double *a, doubke *b, long n) {
    long i, j;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      b[i] = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
        b[i] += a[i*n + j];
    }
  }

  void sum_row2(double *a, doubke *b, long n) {
    long i, j;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      double val = 0;             /* remove memory aliasing */
      for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
        val += a[i*n + j];
      b[i] = val;
    }
  }

#+END_SRC

 - code updates =b[i]= on every iteration
 - must consider possiblities that these updates will
   affect program behavior


** Instruction-Level Parallelism

 - need general understanding of modern processor design
   - hardware can execute multiple instructions in parallel
 - performance limited by data dependencies
 - simple transformations can yield dramatic performance improvement
   - compilers often cannot make these transformations
   - lack of associativity and distributivity in floating point arithmetic

** Superscalar Processor

 - Def: a superscalar processor can issue and execute multiple instructions in one cycle.
   Instructions are retrieved from a sequential instruction stream and are usually scheduled dynamically
 - Benefit: without programming effort, superscalar processor can
   take advantage of the instruction level parallelism that most programs have
 - most modern CPUs are superscalar

*** Pipelined Functional Units

#+BEGIN_SRC C

  long mult_eg(long a, long b, long c) {
    long p1 = a*b;
    long p2 = a*c;
    long p3 = p1*p2;
    return p3;
  }

#+END_SRC

 - divide computations into stages
 - pass partial computations from stage to stage
 - stage i can start on new computation once values passed to i+1
 - e.g. complete 3 multiplications in 7 cycles, even though each requires 3 cycles
