** Cache

 - cache: a smaller, faster storage device that acts as a staging area
   for a subset of data in a larger, slower device
 - fundamental idea of a memory hierarchy
   - for each k, the faster, smaller device at level k serves as a cache
     for the larger, slower device at level k+1
 - why do memory hierarchies work
   - because of locality, programs tend to access the data at level k
     more often than they access the data at level k+1

 - *Big Idea*: The memory hierarchy creates a large pool of storage that
   costs as much as the cheap storage near the bottom, but that serves
   data to programs at the rate of the fastest storage near the top.

*** Memory Mountain

 - read throughput
   - number of bytes read from memory per second
 - memory mountain
   - measured read throughput as a function of spatial and
     temporal locality
   - compact way to characterize memory system performance
     - Temporal locality refers to the reuse of specific data,
       and/or resources, within a relatively small time duration.
     - Spatial locality refers to the use of data elements within
       relatively close storage locations
     - stride
     - size
